### Action points
- Need to find people to help decide what we should be doing when we meet up in person.
- We need to start building graphics.

### Discussion
We're aiming for March next year as a goal to get this project into a position.

We also want to bring in as many vendors and suppliers as possible to get more opinions and questions.

At the start of the meeting we recapped what we've been discussing for the wider group such as should we be using webcomponents and discussed how/should we approach localisation. We also recapped on if the interface in-between the renderer and the server/graphic should be part of the specification at all.

As we have more vendors on this call we have the ability to ask how we should be structuring components in a way that is beneficial to the most.

We spoke with Victoria from Adobe and we discussed how programs like after effects should be able to export 

Can we confirm if we can do realtime with both webcomponents and iframe based.

We need to look to provide something to some of the external suppliers to see if it is something that can be used.

We spoke about building a potential middleware solution to help test/build graphics.
