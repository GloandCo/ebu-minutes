### Action points
- Work out where the project is ready to present on 27th

### Discussion

We spoke about how everything is pretty much there but does require a thorough testing through from multiple potential users and suppliers.

We spoke about what we can do with realtime and non realtime graphics and how we could build out a tick functionality with puppeteer to take screenshots and build out a video.

We're aware of an open source project that would link well with GSAP but want to avoid pushing people down a specific route.
