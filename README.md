# EBU Minutes: Blog

This repo holds all the minutes of our meetings for public viewing.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├   ├──── blog/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

`src/content/blog` is where the minute files live, create a markdown file with any name. Change the `pubDate` to the meeting date and it'll auto sort on the homepage 

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
