# EBU Minutes: Blog

This repo holds all the minutes of our meetings for public viewing.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œÂ Â  â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

`src/content/blog` is where the minute files live, create a markdown file with any name. Change the `pubDate` to the meeting date and it'll auto sort on the homepage
